# Seoul-Bike-Rental-Prediction---AI-Pro---ITI
The Seoul Metropolitan Government launched a public bike-sharing service in 2015 called Seoul Bikes (“Ddareungi” in Korean). It was designed to be a self-operating rental service that could be used conveniently by anyone. Today in Seoul, there are over 150 rental stations centered in five areas of the city (Yeouido, Sangam, Sinchon, the 4 Great Gates area, and Seongsu). Currently there are 2,000 Seoul Bikes available to users, with plans to expand the project in the coming years. Seoul Bikes are a great way to travel distances that are a bit too far to walk, but a bit to close to bother with public transportation or a taxi. The bikes are eco-friendly, user friendly, and low-cost. Take a bike out for a spin and see a new side of Seoul.
